		<h4><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your purchase of Live Phytoplankton includes one 16 
		ounce plastic bottle. Nannochloropsis is a beneficial microalgae found throughout the 
		worldâ€™s oceans. This live phytoplankton has been cultured from a pure sample cultured 
		in agar, using the industry-standard Guiliard f/2 formula fertilizer to promote 
		exponential growth, high nutrient retention, and longer viability.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The genus Nannochloropsis is widely accepted as the standard 
		of reef keeping aquarists, to promote growth and vibrancy of corals, invertebrates, and other 
		livestock. This live phytoplankton may be used as an inoculant to propagate additional quantities,
		if desired. We adhere to the highest standards of sterile laboratory protocols, to ensure that 
		each bottle of dense, vitamin rich Phytoplankton is contaminant-free.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our phytoplankton is cultured using saltwater made from reverse 
		osmosis deionized resin (RODI) water and Instant Ocean saltwater mix, at a salinity of 1.020 sg. 
		Directions: To obtain best results, we suggest the daily addition of 3-4ml to every 100 gallons 
		of saltwater in your system, pouring directly into the display tank, or associated sump. This 
		phytoplankton may be fed to your livestock directly, in order to target specific recipients, if desired.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Storage: To extend the viability of the contents past the 7-day growth
		cycle, remember to refrigerate contents immediately upon receipt and invert bottle once daily. 
		In this manner, contents should retain potency for up to 30 days. Phytoplankton to be used as an
		inoculant should be used within 7 days of receipt, to assure maximum density.</p></h4>
