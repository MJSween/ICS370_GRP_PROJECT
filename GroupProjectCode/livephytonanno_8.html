	<div class="paragraph" id="bio">
		<h4><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nannochloropsis is a beneficial micro algae found 
		throughout the world's oceans. This live phytoplankton has been cultured from an 
		Agar sample, using the industry-standard Guillard f/2 medium formula to promote 
		exponential growth, high nutrient retention, and longer viability. The genus Nannochloropsis
		is widely accepted as the standard for reef keeping aquarists, to promote the growth and 
		vibrancy of corals, invertebrates, and other filter feeder livestock.  </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This live phytoplankton may be used as an inoculant to 
		propagate additional quantities, if desired. At Mercer of Montana, we adhere to the 
		highest standards of sterile laboratory protocols, to ensure that each bottle of dense, 
		vitamin rich Phytoplankton is contaminant-free. To obtain best results when feeding 
		systemically, Mercer of Montana suggests the daily addition of 2-3ml to every 40 gallons 
		of saltwater in your system, pouring directly into the display tank, or associated sump 
		(the cap on this bottle will hold approximately .5 oz). </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Protein skimmer should be turned off during this time, to 
		allow more of your phytoplankton to be absorbed by your livestock. Additionally, or in 
		place of systemic feeding, this Phytoplankton may also be fed to your livestock directly,
		in order to target specific recipients. You may notice a small green cloud form when 
		pouring into your water. This is normal and will disperse immediately throughout your system. </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  To extend the viability of the contents past the 7-day growth
		cycle, remember to refrigerate contents immediately upon receipt and invert bottle(s) once daily.
		In this manner, contents should retain potency for up to 28 days. We always filter when bottling
		this Phytoplankton, so you know you're adding the highest level of purity to your livestock
		and display water.</p></</h4>
