		<h4><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Small, high quality stackable sieves available in 53 micron, 
		120 micron, 250 micron, and 850 micron at an unbeatable price! These sieves are very popular and 
		are available individually or in a set of four sieves. All sieves are constructed of PVC framing
		and laboratory grade stainless steel mesh, and can be used in freshwater or saltwater.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Stacking additional sieves reduces the number of passes required 
		to achieve the separation you desire. These sieves are perfect for yout small cultures of Rotifers,
		Copepods, Amphipods, Daphnia, Ciliates, and Artemia. Larger mesh sizes are useful in removing larger
		unwanted contaminants from culture media. Smaller diameter sieves fit easily into your hand. </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Rough texture and color-coded silicon bands allow for sure grip in 
		wet environment. Silicon bands are debossed with the micron size of the sieve, and along with the 
		glow-in-the-dark color, make identification in low light easy. Sieves are great for rinsing frozen 
		fish food while thawing!</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  For best results when stacking sieves, make sure to place the smaller
		micron sieve at bottom, increasing as additional sieves are stacked on top. For longer service life 
		of sieves, be sure to rinse with distilled or RO/DI water and dry with soft cloth after every use.</p></h4>
