		<h4><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tetraselmis is a beneficial micro algae found throughout 
		the world's oceans. This live phytoplankton has been cultured from isolated Tetraselmis cells 
		suspended in agar, using the industry-standard Guillard f/2 medium formula to promote exponential 
		growth, high nutrient retention, and longer viability. The genus Tetraselmis, extremely popular 
		with reef hobbyists, promotes tremendous growth in all zooplankton organisms, corals, invertebrates,
		and other filter feeder livestock. </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Tetraselmis is a saltwater-only microalgae. This live phytoplankton
		may also be used as an inoculant to propagate additional quantities, if desired. At Mercer of Montana,
		we adhere to the highest standards of sterile laboratory protocols, to ensure that each bottle of dense,
		vitamin-rich phytoplankton is contaminant-free. To obtain best results when feeding systemically, 
		Mercer of Montana suggests the daily addition of 2-3ml to every 40 gallons of saltwater in your system,
		pouring directly into the display tank, or associated sump.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . Additionally, or in place of systemic feeding, this phytoplankton may 
		also be fed to your livestock directly, in order to target specific recipients. To extend the viability
		of the contents past the 7-day growth cycle, we recommend refrigerating contents immediately upon 
		receipt and invert bottle(s) once daily. In this manner, contents should retain potency for up to 28 days. </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  We always filter when bottling this Phytoplankton, so you know you're
		adding the highest level of purity to your livestock and display water.</p></h4>
