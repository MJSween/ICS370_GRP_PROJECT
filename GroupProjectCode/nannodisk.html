  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Live Phytoplankton Petri Dish - Nannochloropsis</h2>
  <img class="center" src="Products/NannoDisk.png" style="width:225px;height:200px;"></img>
	<div class="paragraph" id="bio">
		<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nannochloropsis Oculata is a beneficial microalgae found
		throughout our oceans. This microalgae (Nanno, for short) is a 
		non-motile algae, comprised of very small cells (2-4 microns), 
		that are perfect as a primary food source for feeding your fish 
		fry, and rotifer, artemia, or copepod cultures. Almost all 
		inhabitants of a reef aquarium will also benefit from phytoplankton
		supplementation, particularly any organisms that feed on the 
		nutrients found in the water column. 
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nanno has been the predominant species of microalgae used in the 
		aquarium hobby for many decades, due to the high ratio of Total Omega 3 
		(42.7%) and EPA (30.5%) 
		relative to their weight. Each disk, or petri dish, contains 
		approximately 1-1.5 billion cells, suspended in nutrient agar. To 
		assure a level of control, these disks contain ONLY Nanno, and 
		allows the hobbyist more control over what is fed. Mixtures that 
		include other types of microalgae have their uses, and combining 
		some with Nanno can be beneficial, but why put more in your tank 
		than what is needed/used?</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cells on these disks are live and will
		remain viable up to six months or longer. Microalgae disks are 
		compact, store easily, and remove the need to create/maintain liquid
		subcultures for backup. Also, disks are much cheaper to ship than 
		liquid starter cultures. Starting a live phytoplankton culture in 
		the home is easy and requires very space. To successfully use these 
		disks, simply place some culture water on the cells and replace lid 
		of petri dish. Provide room lighting for 12-24 hours. Using sterile 
		swab (included), gently rub cells off the agar and into 250-500ml of
		culture water. Aerate 24/7 and incubate for 6-9 days with a 16+ hour
		daily photoperiod. Dense culture can then be harvested and/or used 
		as inoculant for additional/larger cultures. Although successful 
		propagation will provide an indefinite supply, densities will begin 
		to diminish after numerous iterations. Culture water should be cold.</h4>
