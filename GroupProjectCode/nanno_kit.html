	<div class="paragraph" id="bio">
		<h4><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Phytoplankton Culturing Kit is perfect for anyone starting 
		their own phytoplankton culture in their home. Included in each Kit: One 16oz bottle of very dense 
		Nannochloropsis Phytoplankton - cultured from our very own petri dishes to assure that each culture
		is species-specific and contains the highest density count obtainable. This phytoplankton has been 
		cultured using Hydro Algal Fertilizer, and RO/DI water mixed with Instant Ocean salt at a specific 
		gravity of 1.020. One 4oz bottle of Hydro Algal Fertilizer as the culture growth medium.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This fertilizer adheres to the Guillard f/2 formula, the gold-standard
		in the aquaria hobby. Contains vitamins B12, Thiamin, and Biotin to ensure a proper balance for maximum
		health. Contains no Silicates. Two 3ml pipettes to administer fertilizer, feed tank occupants, etc.
		Two 1ml syringes, with dispensing caps. Two 3/16" rigid air tubes, approximately 12" each - perfect 
		for use with 2L bottles. Approximately 3 feet of flexible air tubing - 3/16" ID, 1/4" OD. </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Tubing is perfect for use with included rigid air tubes, and most
		(if not all) aquarium air pumps. Includes common sense, written instructions on starting your own 
		culture. Storage - Phytoplankton: To extend the viability of the phytoplankton contents past the 
		7-day growth cycle, remember to open each container (to assure gas exchange after shipping) 
		immediately upon receipt, refrigerate contents, and invert bottle once daily (do not shake). </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this manner, unused contents should retain potency for up to 30 days.
		Phytoplankton to be used as an inoculant should be used within 7 days of receipt, to assure maximum 
		density. Hydro Algal Fertilizer: Keep unused fertilizer in cool, dark place for up to two years. Shake well before use.</p></h4>
